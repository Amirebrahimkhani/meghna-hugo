Hi there,

I'm a well-rounded resourceful linchpin engineer with 15+ years of experience developing banking and business-critical software applications, mainly as an architect and technical lead, always committed to delivering quality work I feel proud of.

If you have an idea and want to build it, stuck with your legacy product, or spent so much on tech without much return, letâ€™s talk!

Cheers,
Jahan
