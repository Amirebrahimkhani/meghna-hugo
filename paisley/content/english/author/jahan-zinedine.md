Hi there,

I am a Full-Stack Developer with more than a decade of experience. In my experience, I was
involved in more than 30 projects with the subjects of E-banking, Telecom, human resource, Inventory
Management, CMS, and office information system. In my career, I would very much like to join a reputable
and forward-thinking company where apart from contributing to the success of your business I can also be
given the opportunity to advance my knowledge. I remain attentive to details Strong problem-solving skills
and ability to learn new things quickly provide technical support for a team of 30 developers in online
banking project A Recent achievement is the satisfaction of this Bank by localizing and implementing banking
REST services and widgets for the established clientsâ€™ portal with the collaboration of Backbase company. 

Cheers,
Meysam
