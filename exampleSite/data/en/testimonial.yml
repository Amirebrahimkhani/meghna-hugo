    content:  AmirHossein (Najmi) did everything I asked for in a timely manner and he also helped to solve problems that I had not envisioned.  
       His knowledge of the subject and his analysis of my problem allowed him to contribute more than just coding, 
       which was extra value I did not know that I would need.  So I highly recommend Amir as a solution architect and Java developer for complex applications.  
       I will continue to work with him whenever possible.
