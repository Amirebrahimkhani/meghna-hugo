    content:  Simply Amazing! Not often you find a freelancer that has passion for what he does
      but also has the heart of a teacher. Good attention to details, goes above and beyond what you asked for,
      Great Communicator... There is just too much to mention here.  I will continue to hire for future projects!

    content: I am very happy with Jahan's work.  It was efficient, and did the job perfectly.
      Even better, he spent much more time than he originally thought it would take to help me integrate the code he wrote.

    content:  Amir did everything I asked for in a timely manner and he also helped to solve problems that I had not envisioned.  
       His knowledge of the subject and his analysis of my problem allowed him to contribute more than just coding, 
       which was extra value I did not know that I would need.  So I highly recommend Amir as a solution architect and Java developer for complex applications.  
       I will continue to work with him whenever possible.
